        Created by the <a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/design-thinking" target="_blank">Design Thinking Initiative</a> at <a href="https://www.smith.edu/" target="_blank">Smith College</a>, 
        this project is the result of Smith students’ questions - Where can I make objects? 
        Where can I learn new skills? We have a woodshop on campus? How do I gain access to these spaces? 
        Our making spaces are scattered across campus but rich in resources - students of all majors have access to materials and tools from paint to CNC routers. 
        This map is an effort to consolidate these resources into one living document.</p>
